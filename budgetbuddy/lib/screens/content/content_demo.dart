You're at the mall with your friends, and you have **\$50** in your pocket. You want to buy some new clothes for the school dance next week.

As you walk into your favorite store, you see:

- A nice shirt for **\$25** 
- Some jeans for **\$35**

Even though the jacket was cool, spending almost all your money on one thing wasn't the best choice. 

**Key Takeaways:**
- Always leave some money for unexpected expenses
- Consider if you really need something before buying it
- It's okay to save money for later

**Next time:** Try to spend only 50-70% of your budget on wants, and save the rest!

## What is a Budget? üí∞

A **budget** is a plan for how you'll spend your money. Think of it like a roadmap for your finances!

**Key Points:**
- A budget helps you track income and expenses
- It prevents overspending
- It helps you save for goals
- It gives you control over your money

**Simple Formula:**
```
Income - Expenses = Savings (or Debt)
```

*The goal is to have money left over for savings!*

## Creating Your First Budget üìù

**Step 1: List Your Income**
- Allowance
- Part-time job
- Birthday money
- Any other money you receive

**Step 2: List Your Expenses**
- Food and snacks
- Entertainment (movies, games)
- Transportation
- Savings goals

**Step 3: Compare**
- If Income > Expenses = You're doing great!
- If Expenses > Income = You need to adjust

**Pro Tip:** Start with a simple 50/30/20 rule:
- 50% for needs
- 30% for wants  
- 20% for savings
